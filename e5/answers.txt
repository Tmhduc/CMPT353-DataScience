1. Out of all the transforms suggested, square root transformation got me the closest to satisfying the assumptions of a T-test, which are normality and variances
2. The pvalue of original data normality and equal-variance states that the average number of comments posted on weekdays is different from weekends.
After applying the square root transformation, there's no different from the average number of comments posted on weekdays and weekends.
3. The T-Test using Central Limit Theorem likely gives the most reliable answer for a few reasons:
    - the Central Limit Theorem helps ensure the data is approximately normally distributed, satisfying the assumptions of the T-Test
    - Grouping helps reducing the impact of outliers and daily fluctuations
4. More comments are posted on weekdays than weekends.
