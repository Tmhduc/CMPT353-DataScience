1. Based on the result I got from the last question, I think daily temperatures and population density have a positive correlation.
The bigger the average of maximum temperature of a city, the more population density it has. There are a couple of outliers but the trend still give us an insight that people tend to live in a warmer city.
2. Using a compressed file is faster to work with than an uncompressed json file because we have a large amount of data.
Compressing a large data json file will have us a smaller sized file on the disk. We will make less trip to the disk we cannot store all the data on the RAM.
If the dataset is small adn frequent random access is required, then an uncompressed format may be more efficient. This is unfortunately not the case.
