1. There are a total of 1669 different results for each different timestamps.
For example, 13.185763 is the predicted rating for the first timestamp, 
and 13.480725 is the predicted rating for the last timestamp in the list.

Name: TimeStamp, Length: 1669, dtype: float64
The type of the result is a Pandas Series, and the type for all values is float64
The numbers are the model's best estimate for ratings with respect to respective timestamps.
These values are calculated using the linear relationship defined through function linregress.

2. For every timestamp x, we apply the equation and get the predicted rating y. 
Timestamps are a numeric proxy for dates. We use .timestamp() to convert to numeric timestamps for every datetime values.
By doing this, we maintain a one-to-one correspondence between the original dates and the numeric values.
