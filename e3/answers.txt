1. When smoothing the CPU temperature, I think I get a better result with Kalman smoothing. 
Kalman filtering gives me a more accurate estimation for each data points, whereas LOESS give me a general information as to how the data points are plotted
2.With more data such as timestamp and speed, I could have made a better approximation of the duration it takes to reach the destination.
I use mygpsfiles website to graph the gpx file and the time between original data points giving and that of smoothed data points is no much different.
It tells us that we need to take into account more data to have better approximations.
